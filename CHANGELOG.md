## [Unreleased]

## [0.1.1] - 2026-06-07

A review, hardening and performance pass. No configuration changes required.

### Fixed

- A failing database query for one monitor no longer blanks out the whole status
  page or `/api/summary`; that monitor degrades to an `unknown` card instead.
- `docker stop` now triggers a graceful shutdown — the server listens for
  `SIGTERM` in addition to `Ctrl-C`/`SIGINT`.
- The shared HTTP client now has request and connect timeouts, so a hung
  Telegram API connection can no longer stall a monitor's probing loop.
- `timeout_secs = 0` is rejected at load instead of silently disabling probing.
- The config file-watch reload no longer risks a blocking send off the runtime.
- The failing-response body snippet is now strictly bounded in size.

### Performance

- A covering index on `checks (monitor_id, time, status, latency_ms)` makes the
  availability, daily-bar and latency-series queries index-only (no per-row
  table lookups), so the status page stays fast as history grows.
- `synchronous = NORMAL` under WAL: probe inserts no longer `fsync` on every
  write, only at checkpoints.
- A larger SQLite page cache (16 MiB) keeps the hot index resident across the
  cached summary rebuilds.

### Security

- The Telegram bot token is redacted in `Debug` output, so it can never leak
  through a log line or panic message that formats the configuration.

### Changed

- The Docker image runs as a non-root user (UID 10001) and ships a `HEALTHCHECK`.
- The database pool now has a 10 s acquire timeout, so contention degrades a
  single card instead of hanging the page.
- Reproducible builds: `--locked` is enforced in CI and the Docker build.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-06-07

Initial release.

### Added

- **Monitors** — HTTP and TCP probes with per-monitor interval, timeout, expected
  status, a "degraded if slower than" threshold, and custom request headers.
- **Status page** — server-rendered (no JS framework) compact, responsive grid:
  daily uptime bars graded by severity, an inline SVG 24h latency chart,
  auto-refresh, Cal Sans branding and an SVG favicon.
- **JSON API** — `GET /api/summary` and `GET /api/monitors/{id}/latency`, plus a
  generated OpenAPI 3.1 document at `/api/openapi.json` (`utoipa`).
- **Badges** — embeddable flat SVG status and uptime badges per monitor at
  `/api/badge/{id}/status` and `/api/badge/{id}/uptime`.
- **TLS certificate expiry monitoring** with advance warnings.
- **Notifications** — a pluggable `Notifier` trait with a built-in Telegram
  channel; alerts fire only after _N_ consecutive failures (anti-flapping),
  include a snippet of the failing response body, and a recovery message.
- **Storage** — SQLite (sqlx) with per-monitor retention and automatic pruning.
- **Live configuration reload** — file-watch and `SIGHUP`: monitors, thresholds,
  retention and notification channels are reconciled in place, with no downtime
  for unchanged monitors.
- **API hardening** — per-IP rate limiting (`x-ratelimit-*` / `retry-after`
  headers), strict Content-Security-Policy, `X-Content-Type-Options` and
  `Referrer-Policy`.
- **Performance** — a lock-free, single-flight summary cache (busted on config
  reload) and concurrent per-monitor queries keep responses fast under load.
- **Packaging** — a static musl binary in a ~25 MB Alpine image (multi-arch
  amd64/arm64), with GitHub Actions for CI (fmt, clippy, tests, cargo-deny) and
  publishing to GHCR.
